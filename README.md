Spark Churn Analysis Project
============================

Overview
--------

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of user interactions within a music application, focusing on predicting user churn using Apache Spark and Python. The project encompasses data exploration, data wrangling, feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

Project Structure
-----------------

### 1\. Dataset

-   Source: "medium-sparkify-event-data.json"
-   Description: Records every user action in the music application.
-   Columns:
        -   **artist** - the artist of the soundtrack,
        -   **auth** - variable indicating whether the user has cancelled the subscription or not,
        -   **firstName** - first name of the user,
        -   **gender** - gender of the user,
        -   **ItemInSession** - Item ID for each session (row) recorded,
        -   **lastName** - last name of the user,
        -   **length** - length of each session by the user,
        -   **level** - the level of subscription of the user (free trial or paid),
        -   **location** - location data of the user (city and state),
        -   **method** - method of access to the page (PUT or GET)
        -   **page** - the page in Sparkify the user visited in each session,
        -   **registration** - userâ€™s registration timestamp,
        -   **sessionId** -  a session id,
        -   **song** - the song listened to in each session, by the user,
        -   **status** - result of the request while accessing,
        -   **ts** - the timestamp of each session,
        -   **userAgent** - the user agent used by the user to visit sparkify,
        -   **userId** - unique number identifying each user.

### 2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Summary:
    -   543,705 rows and 18 columns.
    -   Gender distribution: 198 women, 250 men (448 unique users).
    -   117 users downgraded subscriptions.
    -   15,700 records with no user IDs.
    -   Popular pages: "Next Song," "Home," "Thumbs Up."
    -   User locations: New York, Los Angeles, Boston.
    -   Popular artists: "Kings of Leon," "Coldplay," "Florence."
    -   Listening peak: 15:00-17:00.

### 3\. Data Wrangling

-   Transformation of registration and timestamp columns into Unix time.
-   Removal of rows with no user or session ID.
-   Creation of a user dataframe for churn activities (churn_matrice).

### 4\. Feature Engineering

-   Creation of a feature matrix with user IDs and various behavioral metrics.
-   Metrics include session count, average session time, song-related actions, and page interactions.

### 5\. Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier

-   Features normalized using Standard Scaler.
-   Training of Random Forest classifier.
-   Dataset split into training and testing sets.
-   Model evaluation based on the F1 score (0.69).

### 6\. Machine Learning: Pipeline and GridSearch

-   Three pipelines for logistic regression, random forest, and gradient-boosted tree classifiers.
-   Feature columns assembled into vectors and standardized.
-   Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation.
-   Model performance assessed using the F1 score.
